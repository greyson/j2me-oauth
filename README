This is the j2me OAuth implementation, with modifications by
DXY Solutions (http://www.dxysolutions.com/) for use in BlackBerry.

The original implementation uses BouncyCastle for its hashing algorithm,
however, since the BlackBerry has (the distinct possibility of) hardware
acceleration for its built-in API.

For a instructions on how to use this library to implement automatic OAuth,

This can save users from having to input the token on their return to the
application.
